## Task 1: Week 4 Knowledge Consolidation (25 minutes)

### What You'll Do
Review and consolidate all storage concepts covered this week through active recall and practical verification.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Storage Concepts Mind Map
```bash
# Create comprehensive storage mind map
cat > storage-concepts-review.md << 'EOF'
# Week 4 Storage Concepts Review

## Persistent Volumes (PVs)
- Lifecycle: Available → Bound → Released → Failed
- Reclaim Policies: Retain, Delete, Recycle
- Static vs Dynamic Provisioning
- Node Affinity and Local Storage

## Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)  
- Resource Requests: storage, accessModes
- Storage Class Selection
- Volume Binding Process
- Expansion Capabilities

## Volume Types
### EmptyDir
- Use Cases: Temporary storage, inter-container communication
- Memory backing: medium: Memory
- Size Limits: sizeLimit parameter
- Lifecycle: Pod-scoped

### HostPath
- Use Cases: Node-specific data, system monitoring
- Security Implications: Host access risks
- Path Types: Directory, DirectoryOrCreate, File, FileOrCreate
- Node Binding: Ties pod to specific node

### ConfigMap Volumes
- Configuration Management: Externalized config
- Update Behavior: Eventually consistent updates
- File Permissions: defaultMode settings
- Immutable ConfigMaps: immutable: true

### Secret Volumes
- Secure Data: Encrypted at rest
- Permission Control: defaultMode 0400
- TLS Certificates: kubernetes.io/tls type
- Base64 Encoding: Automatic handling

## Access Modes
- ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Single node access
- ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Multi-node read access  
- ReadWriteMany (RWX): Multi-node write access

## Storage Classes
- Dynamic Provisioning: Automated PV creation
- Binding Modes: Immediate vs WaitForFirstConsumer
- Expansion Control: allowVolumeExpansion
- Default Classes: is-default-class annotation
- Parameters: Provider-specific settings

## Volume Troubleshooting
- Pending PVCs: No matching PV, wrong access mode
- Mount Failures: Permission issues, missing volumes
- Performance Issues: Wrong volume type selection
- Binding Problems: Incorrect storage class, node affinity
